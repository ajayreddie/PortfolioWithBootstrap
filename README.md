# PortfolioWithBootstrap

This is the readme file of Portfolio Assignment 5A

I have designed my personal portfolio website
Here I have used html and css and bootstrap
First of all i used <!Doctype html> tag to know the document type
The main page has home, about, skills, contact and certifications categories
I started with navbar element and added all tabs
Then I added carousal and added 3 images of mine.
Then I added skills section with progress bar elements
Then I added acdemics with table element
Then I added my 3 projects with accordian elements
Then I added 4 certificates with cards elements
Then I added a feedback popover element
Then I added a Terms and conditions modal element
Then I added a contact me button with colapse element
Then I added few buttons with links of my social media accounts to contact me
I have given several buttons and when you click on it, it will redirect to my respective profile.
